This repository contains a Bash script that simulates a simple e-commerce site. The script allows users to perform basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on a text-based database of products.

## Features

- View all products in the database.
- Update existing products by ID, allowing modification of name and price.
- Delete products by ID, removing them from the database.

## Prerequisites

- Bash: The script is written in Bash and requires a Bash-compatible shell environment.

## Database

  - The product database is stored in the products.txt file.
  - Each line in the file represents a product and has the following format: ID|Name|Price.
  - The products.txt file is created automatically when the script is run for the first time.
